Bilkul! Pehle mujhe thoda sa bata do:

Bot ka full name kya hai? (jaise "Phantom Guard" ya kuch aur?)

Bot kis purpose ke liye hai? (moderation, security, fun, multipurpose, etc.)

Kya koi specific colors ya style chahiye logo me? (dark theme, techy, shield symbol, neon, etc.)

Text chahiye logo me ya sirf symbol?

Kya koi tagline chahiye niche? (optional)

Jitna clear bataoge, utna mast logo bana ke dunga. 😎

Ek ghost-style robot diya hai (phantom feel ke liye),

Shield use kiya protection aur multipurpose power dikhane ke liye,

Neon blue aur dark background se modern Discord vibe maintain ki gayi hai.

Download karne ke liye yahaan click karo ya neeche image pe right-click karke "Save as" karo.

Iska animated version,

Ya transparent background,

Ya kisi aur color theme mein bhi bana sakta hoon.

Bolna bas 😎
